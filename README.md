# BartArt + Arduino

## Overview
Inspired by Camille Utterback’s art work, Entangled, and Alan Rath’s Four Eyes, this is an experimental web app project integrating with Bart API and Arduino board. In browser there is a full screen canvas displaying pop art components. The real time data of Bart system will trig- ger the flying crows. Therefore, when Bart is coming, the crow starts flying. Also, there is ZX sensor that triggers hand flipping and scene changing. So when audience’s hand gets closer, the scene zooms in until the clock and the beating heart appears.

## Technology

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, P5.js, Node.js, Arduino, BART API
